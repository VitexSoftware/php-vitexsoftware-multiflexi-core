## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed array to string conversion for `requirements` and `topics` fields in `Application::importAppJson()`
  - Arrays are now properly converted to comma-separated strings (e.g., `["mServer", "SQLServer"]` â†’ `"mServer,SQLServer"`)
  - Prevents "Array" string being stored in database during JSON imports
  - Reimporting existing JSON files will now correctly update these fields with proper values
